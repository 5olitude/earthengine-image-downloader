# earthengine-image-downloader
This script consists of the most suitable way to integrate geopy and google earth-engine in such a way that you can automatically download the
satellite images for training purposes in machine learning .I have tried the google-colab and the normal  terminal preinstalled packages but the task
here is to give the authentication key its much a difficult task in between code execution.So i prefer you to  use anaconda enviornment it will automatically stores the api in cache and it saves time from a user to reauthenticate
